# argvmanager

## What is this?
`argvmanager` is a small set of utilities for managing argv in a faster way. I'm coding it mainly for my use, but you can use this as well, and eventually improve it.

## What can argvmanager do?
Its basic functionalities will be:
* Add/Remove command line arguments
* Manage every created argument
  * [Re]Assign a function to it
  * Design an accepted type (str/int)
